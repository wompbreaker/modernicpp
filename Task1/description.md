# Task 1: MyBigInt Implementation

Implement type `MyBigInt`, which can represent very large non-negative integer numbers (up to 70 digits). Implementation of the type is already started in file `MyBigInt.hpp`. Type should represent numbers as arrays of digits. 

Implement only functions (methods/operators) that are required for compilation of code in file `exercise1.cpp`, and its correct execution. In short, those are:
- Print to stream with `<<`
- Operator `+`
- Constructors
- Destructor
- Assignment
- Literal

In file `exercise1.cpp` you also need to implement a function for calculating the n-th Fibonacci number, but this time rely on `MyBigInt`.
